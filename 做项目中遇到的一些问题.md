pickBannerImg（index）在methods和computed中都写了，实际运行分别注释让其中一个运行，当在methods中运行是，console.log("listContainer.banner.length", this.listContainer.banners.length)
触发了两次, 一次输出0一次输出4.而在computed中只输出一次0，为什么？他们代码完全一样呀。

- The reason why the console.log statement in the computed section only outputs 0 once while the one in the methods section outputs 0 and 4 is because of when they are executed.
- Computed properties are evaluated lazily, which means that they only run when their dependencies change. In this case, the computed property pickBannerImg is dependent on the listContainer.banners state, which is retrieved from the Vuex store using mapState.
- When the component is mounted, the getBanners action is dispatched to retrieve the banner data, which is stored in the listContainer.banners state. Since the computed property is dependent on this state, it is not evaluated until the state is updated with the banner data.
- On the other hand, the methods section runs immediately when the component is mounted, regardless of whether the state has been updated or not. Therefore, when the pickBannerImg method is executed in the methods section, it may not yet have access to the banner data stored in the Vuex store, hence the console.log statement outputting 0.
- In summary, the computed property pickBannerImg only outputs 0 once because it is evaluated lazily, while the methods section runs immediately regardless of the state's status.
